         My educational journey has been full of challenges, learning, and personal growth.

         <H2>Matriculation (Science Group)</H2>
          School:<b> Faisal Public High School</b>, Karachi
          <br>
          Year Completed: 2022
          <br>
          <br>
          I completed my matriculation in the science group. It was during this time that I developed a basic understanding of technical subjects like Mathematics and Physics. I worked hard, but my marks were not as high as I had hoped. Still, it was a valuable experience that helped me realize the importance of smart learning, not just hard study.

          <h2>ðŸ’» Intermediate (Computer Science Group)</h2>
          <b>Board:</b> Board of Intermediate Education Karachi (BIEK)
          <br>
          <b>Status:</b> Improvement exams appeared â€“ waiting for results
          <br>
          After matric, I chose Computer Science in intermediate because of my growing interest in technology. In my first attempt, my results were not very strong. I faced some difficulties in understanding concepts and managing time. However, I took this as a learning moment â€” not a failure.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's why I decided to appear in improvement exams to perform better and prove to myself that I can grow. Right now, I'm waiting for my improvement results, and I feel much more confident than before.

           <h3>My Future Plans</h3>
           My journey in education has taught me that real success isnâ€™t measured by marks alone â€” itâ€™s about learning, growing, and staying committed to improvement. After completing my intermediate education in Computer Science and appearing in improvement exams, I feel more focused and determined than ever.
           <br>
           <br>
            My next big goal is to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering. I want to build a strong foundation in programming, web development, system design, and emerging technologies. I'm currently building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I plan to explore backend development and mobile app development soon.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alongside my formal education, I have a deep interest in freelancing, content creation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I believe in using technology not only for personal growth but also to help others understand and use it effectively. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve started my own tech YouTube channel and plan to offer freelance web development services in the near future.
            <br>
            <br>
            InshaAllah, I will continue learning, improving, and working toward becoming a skilled software developer who creates value through knowledge, creativity, and service.
