    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    My name is Haider Hussain. I was born on 24th September 2004 in Karachi, Pakistan, where I still live today. My father's name is Hussain Muhammad, and he works as an electrician.My family has always supported me and encouraged me to stay strong and focused.
     <br>
     <br>
     I was born with vision in only one eye. This experience has shaped my perspective, made me stronger, more determined, and deeply thankful to my dear Allah for everything I am able to do. Instead of seeing it as a weakness, I believe it is a part of what makes me unique and special.
     <br>
     <br>
      I am a motivated, curious, and hardworking individual. I enjoy learning new things and improving myself every day. I believe that success doesn’t come overnight — it requires patience, faith, and effort. I always try to stay positive and help others when I can.
     <br>
     <br>
      I’m currently working on building my skills to achieve my dreams. I have a passion for web development and also interested in content creation, and I hope to turn this passion into a successful career. I believe that with the right mindset and strong belief in Allah, anything is possible.

     <h2>Passion, Skills & Plans</h2>
    I am currently learning web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m also exploring the backend side of development and planning to learn app development in the future to expand my skills further.
     <br>
     <br>
    Alongside coding, I have a strong interest in content creation, especially related to technology and tutorials. I run a YouTube channel where I aim to share helpful and informative content in a creative and easy-to-understand style.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the future, I plan to start freelancing in web development, offering services to clients and building real-world projects that solve problems and improve user experiences.

      <h2>My Learning Goals</h2>
       I am currently focused on learning web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to fully understand the fundamentals and practice building real websites.
    <br>
    <br>
         After gaining confidence in frontend development, I started exploring backend development around two months ago. I plan to continue deepening my understanding of how servers, databases, and backend logic work.</p>
<br>
<br>
       Once I’m comfortable with backend technologies, I aim to move into app development to expand my skills across different platforms.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
          I also have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and I plan to explore its concepts and tools in the future as part of my long-term learning journey.
