         <p class="pera2">I was born with vision in only one eye. This experience has shaped my perspective, made me stronger, more determined, and deeply thankful to my dear Allah for everything I am able to do. Instead of seeing it as a weakness, I believe it is a part of what makes me unique and special.</p>
         
         <p pera3>I am a motivated, curious, and hardworking individual. I enjoy learning new things and improving myself every day. I believe that success doesn’t come overnight — it requires patience, faith, and effort. I always try to stay positive and help others when I can.</p>
